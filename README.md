## What is TDD?
> Test Driven Development (TDD) is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. 
In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass 
the test and making code simple and bug-free.
